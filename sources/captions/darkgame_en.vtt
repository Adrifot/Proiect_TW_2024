00:00.000 --> 00:02.160 position:50% align:center line:3%
This horrifying game is <i>The Night Cage</i>.

00:02.156 --> 00:06.000 position:50% align:center line:3%
You and your friends have woke up in a bottomless dark pit with only a candle.

00:06.001 --> 00:10.700 position:50% align:center line:3%
Your goal is to find the key and escape this labyrinth before the darkness consumes you.

00:10.701 --> 00:14.600 position:50% align:center line:3%
Every turn you'll be moving around the labyrinth and illuminating the paths around you.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.100 position:50% align:center line:3%
As you light up new areas, old ones will fade away,

00:17.200 --> 00:20.000 position:50% align:center line:3%
creating a new path for anyone that comes across it.

00:20.001 --> 00:25.400 position:50% align:center line:3%
Eventually, you'll find a room with a skeleton key. You'll grab it and make your run for the escape.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.900 position:50% align:center line:3%
It sounds simple enough, except there's something <b>evil</b> that dwells in this labyrinth.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.900 position:50% align:center line:3%
Every time you're hit, you'll lose time in the labyrinth and your candle will burn out,

00:32.909 --> 00:37.150 position:50% align:center line:3%
leaving you in the darkness to walk blindly, not knowing what horrors lie ahead.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.999 position:50% align:center line:3%
And every type of monster is different. Some of them will hold the keys in their stomach, 

00:41.000 --> 00:43.500 position:50% align:center line:3%
others will destroy paths and turn them into pits,

00:43.800 --> 00:47.800 position:50% align:center line:3%
and even a colossal being that can take away from the space in this labyrinth.

00:47.950 --> 00:52.000 position:50% align:center line:3%
Now if you're able to make it to the gate with all 4 keys, then you'll be able to escape,

00:51.958 --> 00:55.100 position:50% align:center line:3%
but if time runs out, or you're not able to collect enough keys, 

00:55.110 --> 00:58.720 position:50% align:center line:3%
then your candle will fade out and you'll be consumed by this darkness...
